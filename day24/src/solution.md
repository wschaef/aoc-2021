# Solution 

I solved it by pen and paper. After trying some solutions, I gave up to implement a common solution and started to solve my personal input.

The solution is based on the idea, that there are pairs of subprograms, where one is adding some value to z and other remove it (like a stack). 
Next step was to figure out that based on values in my input x was for a type of subprograms always 1 and for the other type always 0. Based on that information it was a matter of small number of trys to get the result.

I do not delete the solution1.ts due to having the way documented.
